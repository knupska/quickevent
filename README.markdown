QuickEvent
==============

QuickEvent allows you to quickly view, add & remove events from your pages in Symphony.  
Do you want an event on 95 out of 100 pages?.. no problem!

- Version: 1.0
- Author: [Nathan Martin](mailto:nathan@knupska.com)
- Build Date: 2010-04-05
- Requirements: Symphony 2.0.8RC1 (Very likely compatible with earlier versions, only tested in 2.0.8RC1)

### Installation

1. Upload the 'quickevent' folder found in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.  
   (If you have retrieved the extension via the download button in github you will have to  
   rename the folder to 'quickevent' as it will be called 'knupska-quickevent-...')  

2. Enable it as usual on the 'Extensions' page (Select 'QuickEvent' and choose 'Enable' from the 'With Selected' dropdown menu, then click 'Apply').

3. The QuickEvent page can now be found under 'Blueprints'

4. To add/remove events from pages simply select/deselect them in the multi-select boxes.

### Important Notes

1. QuickEvent has not yet been used in a production environment (use at your own risk!)

2. This extension does not create any new data at all, either in the configuration files or database.
   It works directly with Symphony's existing event definitions on pages.
   As such any changes made using QuickEvent will be reflected accurately on other Symphony pages (eg. Page -> Edit)
